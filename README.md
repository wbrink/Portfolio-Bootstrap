# Portfolio-bootstrap

This is a re-work of wbrink.github.io/old-portfolio so that the portfolio is now mobile responsive. This is done using Bootstrap 4.4.
Adding a couple of my own media queries allowed me to changed the width of the Bootstrap "container" class to make it fill the whole screen
by removing the padding and giving a max-width of the smalller screen sizes I was making queries for.

The challenge in this project was getting more familiar with bootstrap grid and not just making the site scale down but moving from columns to rows
in the instance of the navbar.
