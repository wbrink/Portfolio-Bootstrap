# Portfolio-bootstrap

This is a re-work of wbrink.github.io so that the portfolio is now mobile responsive. This is done mostly with the help of bootstrap.
There was still a need to use a couple of them to fix some formatting issues.

The challenge in this project was getting more familiar with bootstrap grid and not just making the site scale down but moving from columns to rows
in the instance of the navbar.
